# The lack of disease-modifying therapies in the current dementia epidemic emphasises the importance of targeting earlier disease stages. Cognitive measures alone do not confer # #sufficient sensitivity and specificity for this, motivating research into neuroimaging biomarkers that might detect more subtle early changes. One promising measure, so-called #‘brain age’, has previously been associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, and predictive of future health outcomes. This includes the development of dementia in #observational research cohorts (Wang et al., 2019) (Gaser, Franke, Klöppel, Koutsouleris, & Sauer, 2013). In the BARCODE project we investigate whether baseline brain-age #predicts subsequent dementia diagnosis in people with subject or mild cognitive impairment who have been referred to memory clinics.
